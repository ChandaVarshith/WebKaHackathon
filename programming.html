                <h2>Python</h2>
                <p><q>Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability.</q></p>
                <h5 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><u>Key Concepts</u></h5>
                <p> 
                    <li><b>Syntax:</b> Python has a clean and readable syntax that 
                        emphasizes code readability and simplicity.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Variables and Data Types:</b> Python supports various data types such as integers, floats, strings,
                         lists, tuples, dictionaries, and more. Variables are used to store data values.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Control Structures:</b> Python includes control structures 
                        like if statements, loops (for and while), and conditional expressions.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Functions:</b> Functions are reusable blocks of code that 
                        perform a specific task. They can take parameters and return values.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Modules and Packages:</b> Python code can be organized into modules, which are files containing Python code. Modules can be grouped into packages.
                         Python's extensive standard library is organized into packages.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</b> Python supports OOP principles 
                        such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Exception Handling:</b> Python provides mechanisms for handling exceptions, allowing you to gracefully handle errors and exceptions 
                        that occur during program execution.</li><br>
                    <li><b>File Handling:</b> Python allows you to work with files, reading from 
                        and writing to them using file objects and file-related methods.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Data Structures:</b> Python provides built-in data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, 
                        and sets, as well as support for creating custom data structures.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Iterators and Generators:</b> Python supports iterators and generators, which are used to iterate over sequences of data. 
                        Generators allow for lazy evaluation of data.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Decorators:</b> Decorators are a powerful feature in Python used 
                        to modify the behavior of functions or methods.</li><br>
                    <li><b>List Comprehensions and Generators Expressions:</b> These are concise ways to create lists 
                        and generators, respectively,  based on existing sequences or iterables.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Lambda Expressions:</b> Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Regular Expressions:</b> Python includes the re module for working with regular expressions,
                         enabling pattern matching and text manipulation.</li><br>
